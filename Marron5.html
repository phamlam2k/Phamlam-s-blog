                <p class="mt-3"> <span><strong>Marron 5</strong></span>  is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California.
                    It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, 
                    keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, 
                    and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school.

                <p>
                    After self-releasing their independent album We Like Digging?, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. 
                    The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college. 
                    In 2001, the band re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine.
                    The band signed with Octone Records, an independent record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records 
                    and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. Aided by the singles "Harder to Breathe", "This Love" and "She Will Be Loved", 
                    the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart and went quadruple platinum in 2005. In the same year, the band won the 
                    Grammy Award for Best New Artist. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.

                <p>
                    The band's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long was released in May 2007. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single "Makes Me Wonder", 
                    became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2010, the band released the third album Hands All Over, to mixed reviews, re-releasing a 
                    year later to include the single "Moves like Jagger", which topped the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, Carmichael left the group and was replaced by musician PJ Morton,
                     as the band released the fourth album Overexposed,
                     with the song "One More Night", topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks.

                <p>
                    In 2014, Carmichael rejoined the band alongside Morton to record the fifth album V (pronounced "five"), 
                    with the band signed to Interscope Records and Levine's own label 222 Records. Following the release of V, 
                    it reached number one on the Billboard 200. In 2016, Maroon 5 recruited their long-time collaborator Sam Farrar,
                     as the band continued for the sixth studio album Red Pill Blues, which was released in November 2017. With the addition 
                     of Morton and Farrar, the band's lineup increased to seven members. The successful singles of both albums "Sugar" and 
                     "Girls Like You" peaked at numbers two and one on the Hot 100 chart respectively.
                     Maroon 5 has sold more than 120 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists

        <h5 class="mt-3">2010–2014: Formation and early years</h5>
        <p>Adam Levine was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old and Dusick was 16.
             Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12. The four original members of the band met while attending Brentwood School in Los Angeles.
            While attending Brentwood School, Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined up with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form Kara's Flowers, a rock band.
            The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a "collective crush" on. While they were playing a beach party in Malibu,
            independent producer Tommy Allen heard them play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter John DeNicola,
            who is known for his work on Dirty Dancing (1987) – including "(I've Had) The Time of My Life". Producer Rob Cavallo's management team heard the record 
            Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer them a deal with Reprise Records, re-recording the album. However, after the release of The Fourth World,
            during Levine and Madden's senior year of high school in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s Britpop.
            Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead single, "Soap Disco", was a failure.
            According to Levine, the failure of the album was "a huge disappointment" 
            that nearly led them to break up in 1998. The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after one month.</p>
        
        <p>Dusick and Madden attended college locally at University of California, Los Angeles, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to attend 
            Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music 
            surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote. </p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-3">2002–2006: Songs About Jane and Dusick's departure</h5>
        
        <p>James Valentine attended Berklee College of Music with John Mayer in 1996, where they developed a rapport. In 2002, the two reconnected at 
            a Mayer radio broadcast. After Mayer heard their album, he was so impressed (particularly by "This Love", which became the most successful 
            release off the album and propelled the band to superstardom) that he invited them to open for him during his early 2003 tour. The first single, 
            "Harder to Breathe", slowly started to pick up airplay which helped spur sales of the album. By March 2004, the album had reached the Top 20 of 
            the Billboard 200 and "Harder to Breathe" had made the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 
            200 in September 2004, 26 months after its release; this was the longest period between an album's release and its initial Top 10 appearance since 
            SoundScan results were included in the Billboard 200 in 1991. The album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. This had all happened after
             the band "abandoned its post-grunge roots for a radio-friendly pop-soul sound, even while dabbling in hard rock".[attribution needed] Mayer invited the band 
             to open for him again in 2004. Over the next three years, the band toured virtually non-stop, including visits to seventeen countries. During this time, 
             the band toured with Michelle Branch, Graham Colton, and the Rolling Stones. Other acts the band toured alongside included Gavin DeGraw, Matchbox Twenty, 
             Sugar Ray, The Counting Crows, Phantom Planet, the Hives, Dashboard Confessional,
             Simon Dawes, the Thrills, Thirsty Merc, Marc Broussard, the Donnas, the RedWest, Michael Tolcher, and Guster.</p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-3">2007–2008: It Won't Be Soon Before Long</h5>
        <p>After recording for eight months, Maroon 5's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long, was released worldwide in May 2007 by A&M Octone Records. Levine described 
            the follow-up to Songs About Jane is "sexier and stronger", gaining inspiration from iconic 80s artists such as Prince, Shabba Ranks, Michael Jackson and Talking Heads.
             Ann Powers writing for Los Angeles Times said It Won't Be Soon Before Long is "An icy-hot blend of electro-funk and blue-eyed soul that works its cruel streak with the 
             confidence of Daniel Craig's James Bond". Before its release, "Makes Me Wonder" was the No. 1 selling single and video on iTunes. It was also the No. 1 
             selling album, with more than 50,000 digital pre-sales.[44] After its release, the album broke iTunes sales records its week of release, selling over 101,000 copies.
              The first single "Makes Me Wonder", was released to radio March 27, 2007. The song debuted at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100, the lowest debuting single of the
               group's five chart entries. In the first week of May, the single skyrocketed from a lowly position of No. 64 to No. 1, the biggest jump in Billboard history at the time.
                "Makes Me Wonder" has also achieved No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs, Pop 100, and Hot Dance Club Play charts.[49] The album's songs "Makes Me Wonder", "Wake Up Call", "If I Never See Your Face Again" and "Nothing Lasts Forever", 
            are featured on the third season of the MTV television series The Hills.</p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-3">2009–2012: Hands All Over and Carmichael's hiatus</h5>
        <p>Levine stated that he believed the band was reaching its peak and may make one more album before disbanding. He explained,
             "Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond, like the Rolling Stones".
              Levine later dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up,
             saying: "I love what I do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [but] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon".</p>    
        <p>In January 2009, Maroon 5 performed at the Renaissance Hotel in Washington, D.C. for the "Declare Yourself" event in honor of the inauguration of President Barack Obama.
             The band recorded a cover version of "The Way You Look Tonight",
             which appeared on the Frank Sinatra tribute album His Way, Our Way. It was also included on the soundtrack to the 2010 film Valentine's Day</p>
        <p>Maroon 5's third studio album was recorded in mid 2009 in Switzerland, where the band was joined by record producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange.
            During the band's time on touring along with artists and groups are served as opening acts for the Back to School Tour in November
            , with Kate Earl and Fitz and the Tantrums and the Palm Trees & Power Lines Tour in 2010, with OneRepublic, Bruno Mars, Kris Allen, Ry Cuming,
            VV Brown, Owl City and actor Jason Segel, respectively. The band's third album titled Hands All Over, was released on September 21, 2010.
            On the Billboard 200, the album debuted at number two behind Zac Brown Band's album You Get What You Give.
            Despite the high placement on the Billboard 200 only 142,000 copies were sold, which was relatively weak compared to their previous album 
            It Won't Be Soon Before Long, which debuted at number one with 429,000 copies. The album received mixed reviews from music critics,
            though many of them praised it for its production. The first single of the album "Misery", was released on June 22, 2010 and peaking
            at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. In February 2011, Maroon 5 headlined the Super Bowl XLV pre-show with special guest Keith Urban,
            where the band performing their songs including "Misery" and "Never Gonna Leave This Bed". During a promotion by Coca-Cola in March 2011,
            the band participated in a special studio session during which, with the help of musician PJ Morton, they only had 24 hours to write a completely original song.
            After their time was up, the song "Is Anybody Out There" was released on the Coca-Cola website for free download.</p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-3">2012–2013: Overexposed</h5>
        <p>As Maroon 5 continued to work on their fourth studio album Overexposed, which was released on June 26, 2012. Levine stated that Overexposed is their "most 
            diverse and poppiest album yet". On April 16, Maroon 5 premiered the first single from the album "Payphone", featuring Wiz Khalifa, on the reality 
            competition show The Voice, in which Levine is one of the coaches. "Payphone" debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, eventually peaking at number two. 
            The album's second single "One More Night" was released on June 19, 2012. The song reached number one on the Hot 100, blocking Psy's monster hit "Gangnam Style" from the 
            top spot on the chart for nine consecutive weeks and tied with Carly Rae Jepsen's hit single
            "Call Me Maybe" for most weeks in the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2012</p>
        <p>At the start of their Overexposed Tour in South America, Maroon 5 introduced the newest addition in the band to the audience: their old and close 
            friend Sam Farrar on guitars, occasionally on the bass guitar, percussion, additional keyboards, backing vocals and providing samples and other special 
            effects (using the MPC). Farrar co-wrote and co-produced a few of the band's songs on almost all of their studio albums and also remixed

        <h3 class="content_body">Musical style and influences</h3>
        <p>Maroon 5's musical style has generally been regarded as pop, pop rock, funk rock, dance-pop, blue-eyed soul, neo soul, R&B, and soft rock. Adam Levine 
            has stated: "Everything that's written and performed and put together pretty much comes from us. I just think people would be surprised to know that we're 
            a self-contained unit. We're a band that does their own thing. There's no puppet master." However, in an article about the songwriter and producer
             Benny Blanco, it is revealed that at least some of the band's songs, such as "Moves like Jagger," are the product of efforts by or collaborations with,
              professional songwriters and producers. In the same article, Levine says, "It's almost as if [Benny Blanco] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together 
            at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best."</p>
        <p>Adam Levine cited Britpop band Oasis as "one of the best bands ever" and said "We love Oasis". The band has cited Michael Jackson, 
            The Beatles, The Police,Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, the Bee Gees, Tonic, Prince, Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as influences.
            Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an influence. Furthermore, guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny,
            Bill Frisell and John Scofield, as well as the rock band Queens of the Stone Age. The band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied
            by piano or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like "This Love", "Makes Me Wonder" and "Misery" have a 
            very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as "She Will Be Loved" and
            "Never Gonna Leave This Bed" express a longing for a romantic relationship.
            "Makes Me Wonder" has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War.</p>

        <h3 class="content_body">Controversies</h3>
        <p>In an interview with Variety in November 2018, the frontman of the band, Adam Levine, when asked if the band is pop, rock or urban, said,
             "Something unique to this band is that we have always looked to hip-hop, R&B, all rhythmic forms of music, from back when we were writing our 
             first album to now. Rock music is nowhere, really. I don’t know where it is. If it’s around, no one’s invited me to the party. All of the innovation and the 
             incredible things happening in music are in hip-hop". This statement prompted widespread criticism from rock fans and some rockstars such as Slipknot's 
             frontman Corey Taylor. Despite this backlash, the band saw a continued increase in popularity and commercial success in 2018, 
            leading them to become one of the world's best-selling pop bands. They continue to create mostly hip-hop and pop music.</p>
        <p>On February 27, 2020, the band performed at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile. The presentation, which began 29 minutes late, 
            was listed as "mediocre" by part of the press. Mark Savage of the BBC said that Levine performed the songs with a "lack of energy" and was "out of tune", 
            adding that the disappointment of some fans increased when videos were leaked. The videos showed Levine when he was leaving the stage, angry and saying 
            that "they were deceived", "that was a TV show! ... that was not a concert", and that Viña del Mar is a "shitty city," sparking criticism. Levine later 
            posted on Instagram to apologize 
            for the incident and the band said they had experienced technical difficulties with the audio feed to Levine's ear pieces</p>
