                <p class="mt-3"> <span><strong>Justin Drew Bieber</strong></span>  (/biːbər/; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer. He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, 
                    gaining recognition with the release of his debut EP My World (2009) and soon establishing himself as a teen idol.
                </p>
                <p>Bieber's debut album, My World 2.0 (2010), debuted atop the Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act 
                    to top the chart in 47 years. The album also contained the internationally successful single "Baby", which became the 
                    highest certificated single of all time in the US. His second album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), was the first Christmas album by a
                     male artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, while his third album, Believe (2012), saw experimentation with dance-pop and mature themes.
                      Following Believe, Bieber's public image went through a drastic change through various controversies and legal issues during 2013 and 2014, 
                      leading to Rolling Stone dubbing him "Bad Boy" on their March 2014 issue. However, starting in 2016, he has been setting his priorities on repairing
                       his public image, by taking responsibility for his past wrongdoings and focusing on his mental health.
                     In February 2016, GQ released an article about Bieber's commitment to "reintroduce" himself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    His fourth album, Purpose, was released in 2015. It was preceded by "Where Are Ü Now", a collaboration with Jack Ü, which saw Bieber explore EDM,
                     and win the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. Purpose produced three number-one singles: "What Do You Mean?", "Love Yourself", and "Sorry". 
                     Bieber diversified on later collaborations, with "Cold Water", "Let Me Love You", "I'm the One", and "I Don't Care" reaching the top five in the U.S.,
                      while his remix to "Despacito" tied the then-record for most weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, and "10,000 Hours" won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.
                     His fifth album, Changes was released in 2020, while his sixth album, Justice (2021), produced the US number-one single "Peaches".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 150 million records sold, Bieber is credited with three Diamond certifications from the 
                    RIAA for "Baby", "Sorry" and "Despacito". He has received numerous accolades, including 22 Guinness World Records, two Grammy Awards, a record 21 
                    MTV Europe Music Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, two Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, and a Latin Grammy Award.
                     Time named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and he was included on Forbes'
                     list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside music, Bieber's marriage to Hailey Baldwin has received considerable media attention, and he also starred in the concert films Justin Bieber: Never Say Never (2011) 
                    and Justin Bieber's Believe (2013), 
                    while his personal issues were chronicled in the documentary series Justin Bieber: Seasons (2020).

        <h3 class="content_body">Early life</h3>
       
        <p>Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, and was raised in Stratford, Ontario.
             He is the son of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette, who were never married. Mallette's mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise her son. 
            Bieber's ancestry includes French-Canadian, Irish, English, Scottish, and German</p>
        
        <p>Dusick and Madden attended college locally at University of California, Los Angeles, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to attend 
            Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music 
            surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote. </p>
        
        
        <p>Through his father Jeremy, Bieber has three younger half-siblings. Jeremy and his ex-wife Erin Wagner, who broke up in 2014 after seven years together,
             have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon. Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.
              Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.
             Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has maintained contact with his father.</p>
        
        <p>Bieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the Jeanne Sauvé Catholic School. Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.
             He graduated from high school in Stratford, Ontario, the St. Michael Catholic Secondary School in 2012 with a 4.0 GPA. In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang
              Ne-Yo's "So Sick" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second. Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their 
              family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.
             In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of Avon Theatre steps with a rented guitar during tourism season</p>

        <h3 class="content_body">Carrer</h3>
        <h5 class="mt-3">2008–2009: Career beginnings and My World</h5>  
        <p>When searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident.
             Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted Mallette, who was reluctant because of Braun's Judaism.
              She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!", and, "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?"
               However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At 13, Bieber went to Atlanta,
             Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes. Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.</p>'
        
        <p>Bieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher. Justin Timberlake was also reportedly in the running to sign 
            Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher
             (partly because of the idea that two associated Justins would confuse the market).</p>
        <p>Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A.
             Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group. Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records)
              and appointed Hicks as executive Vice-President of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label. Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother
             to pursue further work with Braun and Usher. Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.</p>
        
        <p>Bieber's first single, "One Time", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album. The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100
            during its first week of release in July 2009 and later peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. During fall 2009, 
            it had success in international markets. The song was certified platinum in Canada and the US and gold in Australia and New Zealand. His first release, 
            an extended play titled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, "One Less Lonely Girl", and two promo singles,
            "Love Me" and "Favorite Girl", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100.</p>
        <p>
            "One Less Lonely Girl" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top 20 in Canada and the US, and was certified gold in the latter. My World was eventually 
            certified platinum in the US and double platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom. To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows such as

             YouTube video ever. However, Taylor Swift's video for her single "Blank Space" (2014) surpassed its number of views in 2015. In September 2010, it was
             reported that Bieber accounted for 3% of all traffic on Twitter, according to an employee of the social-networking site

        <h5 class="mt-3">2012–2014: Believe, Journals, and other appearances</h5>
        <p>In late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, entitled Believe. The following week, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres 
            Show to announce that the first single would be called "Boyfriend", and was released on March 26, 2012. The song debuted at number two 
            on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut digital sales week. Bill Werde 
            of Billboard noted that it failed to debut at number one because the digital download of the track was available only through the iTunes Store, 
            "restricting the buying option for those [who] do not frequent the Apple retail store". "Boyfriend" became Bieber's first single ever to reach 
            the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week. Bieber was featured on American hip hop group Far 
            East Movement's song "Live My Life", from their fourth studio album Dirty Bass, in February 2012. The song emerged online five days before its scheduled 
            release date and peaked within the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100. The first promotional single from the album, "Die in Your Arms", was released on 
            May 29, 2012, and the second promotional single, "All Around the World" featuring American rapper Ludacris, followed the next week. The second 
            single from Believe, "As Long as You Love Me"
            featuring rapper Big Sean, was released on June 11, 2012. It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
        <p>
            His third studio album, Believe, was released on June 19, 2012, by Island Records. The album marked a musical departure from the teen pop sound of his previous releases, 
            and incorporated elements of dance-pop and R&B genres. Intent on developing a more "mature" sound, Bieber collaborated with a wide range of urban producers for the 
            release as well as some long-time collaborators, including Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo, and Max Martin. Entertainment Weekly praised Bieber's musical shift, calling the 
            album both a "reinvention and a reintroduction". Rolling Stone noted the deeper voice and more "intense" beats found on the album, although it lampooned one of his 
            euphemisms for newfound sexual maturity ("If you spread your wings, you can fly away with me"). Believe debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his fourth 
            number-one album. The album sold 57,000 copies in its first week in Canada, debuting atop the Canadian Albums Chart. In September 2012, Bieber was featured 
            on "Beautiful", a song from Carly Rae Jepsen's second studio album, Kiss (2012). In October 2012, the third single from Believe, "Beauty and a Beat" featuring rapper 
            Nicki Minaj, was released.
             The music video held the record for the most video views in 24 hours when it was released, with 10.6 million views.

            male artist in almost a decade to have three number-ones from an album since Justin Timberlake last did it with his album FutureSex/LoveSounds in 2006/2007.[citation needed] 
            "Company" was announced as the fourth single on March 8, 2016.

        <h3 class="content_body">Artistry</h3>
        <h5 class="mt-3">Musical style</h5>
        <p>Bieber's music is mainly pop and R&B. In 2010, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone asserted that the content of his music was "offering a gentle introduction to the 
            mysteries and heartaches of adolescence: songs flushed with romance but notably free of sex itself". In January 2012, Bieber told V magazine that he doesn't 
            want to sing about sex, drugs and swearing. He stated "I want to do it at my own pace. I don't want to start singing about things like sex, drugs and swearing.
            I'm into love, and maybe I'll get more into making love when I'm older. But I want to be someone who is respected by everybody." But since then, Bieber 
            gradually altered his artistry, with Peter Gicas of E! Online describing "PYD" as "sexed-up", while In Touch Weekly magazine describing his song with Maejor Ali 
            and Juicy J "Lolly" might make his fans a bit uncomfortable because of its lyrics.
            After his hit in 2015 on Jack Ü's track "Where Are Ü Now", Bieber released the EDM-fuelled album Purpose a collaboration with Diplo, DJ Snake and Major Lazer.</p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-3">Influences</h5>
        <p>
            Bieber has cited Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Boyz II Men, Mariah Carey, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, Tupac, and Usher as his musical inspirations. 
            Believe was influenced by Timberlake, for which Bieber was trying to "create a new sound that people aren't really used to hearing ... like when [Timberlake]
            did FutureSex/LoveSounds: It was a new sound... acoustic guitar over hard drums." Bieber and his work have influenced various recording artists including
            Why Don't We, Johnny Orlando, Niall Horan, and Billie Eilish, with Eilish's mom recalled she and her husband considered taking Eilish to therapy
            over her obsession with Bieber's single and music video for "As Long As You Love Me" in 2012.
            Singers Dua Lipa and Charlie Puth have stated that they were influenced by the discovery of Bieber on YouTube which inspired them to achieve the same.
        </p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-3">Voice</h5>
        <p>
            Bieber initially sang with a boy soprano voice, before his voice broke, as was evidenced during the debut performance of "Pray" 
            at the 2010 American Music Awards. Sean Michaels of The Guardian described puberty as "the biggest threat to his career" at the time.
            Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with "swing and rhythmic dexterity" on his debut album, noting his tone to be "nasal".
