        <p>Growing up, Puth was bullied at school. He stated, 
          "They would team up against me so bad and they would kick me in a place that wouldn't feel fantastic and I would need to
           throw up and they would then say I was pretending to throw up."</p>
      
        <p>He has also disclosed on On Air with Ryan Seacrest that he suffered a 
          nervous breakdown. He stated: "[The nervous breakdown happened from] just 
          being overworked and I'm in my head a lot and that, in combination with 
          jet-lag and you know the self realization that I am getting more famous 
          and my privacy goes out the window pretty much every day, it's just not 
          what I'm used to and I don't think I'm ever going to be used to it and my 
          therapy is to just put melody to it and sing it."</p>
      
        <p>Puth has collaborated with teen clothing brand Hollister Co. since 2017.</p>
      
        <p>Puth has said that Justin Bieber's "viral leap into superstardom as a result of YouTube" 
          influenced him to achieve the same.</p>
