                <p class="mt-3"> <span><strong>BTS</strong></span>  (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, 
                    is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
                    The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. 
                    Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused 
                    on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming-of-age, loss, 
                    the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts 
                    and includes an alternative universe storyline. 
                    The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After debuting in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language
                     studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea.
                      By 2017, BTS crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records. 
                      They became the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", 
                      as well as the first Korean act to top the US Billboard 200 chart with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). BTS also became the fastest group 
                      since the Beatles to earn four US number-one albums, doing so in less than two years. Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified 
                      platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100 with 
                      their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite" and remix of "Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)" and, with the release of "Life Goes On", 
                    became the first group to have two number one debuts on the Hot 100.

                <p>
                  Having sold over 20 million albums on the Gaon Music Chart, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds 
                  the best-selling album in South Korea with Map of the Soul: 7. They are the first and only Asian and non-English speaking act 
                  to be named the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year (2020) and to chart on Billboard's Top Touring Artists of the 2010s 
                  (placing at number 45). During their Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline 
                  and sell out Wembley Stadium and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history. Featured on Time's 
                  international cover as "Next Generation Leaders", BTS has also appeared in the magazine's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) 
                  and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019), where they were dubbed "Princes of Pop". Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of 
                  Korea in 2018 and 2020, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. As of 2019, BTS is purportedly 
                  worth more than US$4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP.[6] They attract one in every 13 foreign tourists who visited South Korea 
                  and were cited as one of the key acts in boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout their career, BTS received numerous accolades for their work, including 6 American Music Awards, 
                  9 Billboard Music Awards and 24 Golden Disk Awards, and nominations for a Grammy Award and a Brit Award.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the establishment of their Love Myself anti-violence campaign in partnership with UNICEF, BTS addressed the United Nations 73rd and 75th General 
                  Assemblies and became the youngest ever recipients of the 
                  Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.

        <h3 class="content_body">Name</h3>
        <p>The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團), literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". 
          According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents 
          like bullets".In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団), which translates similarly. In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity.[11] This extended their name to mean 
          "growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward."</p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">2010–2014: Formation and early years</h5>
        <p>BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.BTS was originally 
          supposed to be a hip-hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM, but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided that the 
          contemporary youth needed instead "a hero who can lend them a shoulder to lean on, even without speaking a single word".The group was meant to debut in 
          2011 and featured on several tracks by artists such as 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before their debut was postponed and the group was reorganized into a more 
          traditional idol group.The lineup was then finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in 2012. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain 
          attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.</p>
        <p>On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, the first installment in their "school trilogy" 
          series, simultaneously with its lead single "No More Dream", which peaked at number 124 in Korea before quickly falling off the charts.
           While the album peaked at number five in South Korea and eventually sold over 145,000 copies,it was not a major hit, selling only 24,000 copies in 2013.
           Their subsequent single “We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2” failed to chart. In 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound with scratches from the 1980s–90s 
           and excessively fierce visuals.BTS have stated that from their inception, they were convinced that telling their story was the only way for the younger generation 
           to relate to their music.The lyrics of the album primarily reflected on the misunderstanding and prejudice towards them, criticism of the society that diminishes 
           their dreams, and their anxiety and determination towards their future.During the production of the album, Suga and RM rewrote the lyrics of “No More Dream” more 
           than 20 times.The single album's release was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows.Despite being unpolished, critics say these early live 
           performances demonstrated BTS' potential with their intense and charismatic stage presence.[26] Expanding their endeavors to Japan, 
          "No More Dream" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014</p>
        <p>In September 2013, BTS released the second part to their "school trilogy,” the extended play O!RUL8,2?, along with its single "N.O,” which peaked at number 92 in Korea.
          The EP peaked at number four in Korea and has sold over 160,000 copies to date, including 34,000 copies in its release year.Musically, BTS did not fundamentally 
          change their sound as compared with 2 Cool 4 Skool, utilizing fiery rapping along with trap beats, brass, and soulful melodies. Lyrically, the EP expanded on the t
          heme of dreams and happiness, revealing their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and their determination to confront the struggle of proving themselves.
           Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts.That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV's Rookie 
           King Channel Bangtan, based on a fake broadcast station, "Channel Bangtan", through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea.
           At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, 
          including the 5th Melon Music Awards, 28th Golden Disc Awards and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards</p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">2014–2015: Moderate success and first concert tour</h5>
        <p>The last act of their "school trilogy", the EP Skool Luv Affair, was released in January 2014 and topped the Gaon Album Chart, selling 100,000 copies in 2014 
          and over 250,000 copies overall.It also marked BTS' first appearance on Billboard's World Albums Chart, peaking at number three.The album was supported by the 
          singles "Boy in Luv" (Korean: 상남자; RR: Sang-namja) and "Just One Day" (Korean: 하루만; RR: Haruman), which peaked at number 45 and number 149 in Korea, respectively.
          While Skool Luv Affair musically retained much of their hip-hop influences with the incorporation of R&B and hard rock, the album coincided with a thematic shift 
          from dreams and happiness to love, focusing on school-age and youthful love.Following Skool Luv Affair's release, BTS made several appearances on Korean music 
          shows and held their first fan meeting that March with an audience of 3,000 fans in Seoul.That July, BTS held their first concert in the 
          United States in West Hollywood for free to an audience of 200 fans.In August, the group also made their first appearance at KCON in Los Angeles</p>
        <p>In August 2014, BTS released their first Korean studio album, Dark & Wild, which peaked at number two in Korea and sold over 200,000 copies total.
          It was supported by two singles: "Danger" and "War of Hormone" (Korean: 호르몬 전쟁; RR: Horeumon Jeonjaeng), which peaked at number 58 and number 173 in Korea, respectively.
           The album served as a narrative extension of the “school trilogy” and a transition into their next series. Musically, the album fused the grungy electric guitar sounds 
           of rock within the framework of hip-hop and continued to expand their sound towards R&B. The central theme of the album's lyrics focused on expressing the sentiments of
            maturing, youthful desires, and impatience for romance.During production of the album, BTS recorded their single "Danger" in a makeshift studio in a garage in Los
             Angeles.Following several appearances on Korean music shows, BTS embarked on their first concert tour, 2014 BTS 
          Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, from October to December, held in various halls and theaters in six cities: Seoul, Kobe, Tokyo, Manila, Singapore, and Bangkok</p>
        <p>Their first Japanese studio album, Wake Up (2014), released that December, peaked at number three on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart and sold 28,000 copies.
          Along with re-recorded Japanese versions of older songs, it also contained the original tracks "Wake Up" and "The Stars." In support of the album, BTS held 
          their 1st Japan Tour 2015 Wake Up: Open Your Eyes in February 2015 to an audience of 25,000 fans in four cities.
          After ending their Japan tour, BTS held their second solo concert in Korea, BTS Live Trilogy Episode I: BTS Begins, in March to a crowd of 6,500 fans</p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-3">2015–2016: Mainstream breakthrough and commercial success</h5>
        <p>Shifting their sound and image from solely aggressive, masculine hip hop to more diverse styles,BTS wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of "youth"
           and settled on the title of "花樣年華" (Korean: 화양연화; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa), loosely interpreted to define "youth" as "the most beautiful moment in life."
           Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (March 2015), explored the growth and emotional agony of youth as well as its playful and uplifting sides.
            Fuse included it as the only Korean album on their list of the "27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far."[55] The EP has sold over 415,000 copies to date.
            Its lead single "I Need U" was BTS' first top five hit in Korea and garnered BTS first ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show.[58] While its second single,
             "Dope (Korean: 쩔어; RR: Jjeoreo)", only peaked at number 44 in Korea,it peaked at number three on Billboard's World Digital Songs Chart and became their
              first music video to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube in October. The group began the world tour extension of their Red Bullet Tour in June, titled 
              2015 Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and Latin America.Their fourth Japanese single, "For You", 
              was released on June 17 to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese debut and topped Oricon's daily chart, selling over 42,000 copies within its first day.
          BTS later performed at Japan's Summer Sonic Festival on August 15 and 16.</p>
        
          <h5 class="mt-3">2018: Worldwide recognition</h5>
          <p>In the lead up to their next album, BTS released an original eight-episode documentary series exclusively on YouTube Premium entitled Burn the Stage 
            that ran from March until May 2018, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the group's 2017 Wings Tour. In April, the group also released their 
            third Japanese studio album, Face Yourself, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200 as the third-highest-charting Japanese album in the history 
            of the chart. In conjunction with the release of Face Yourself, the group released a nine-minute short film titled "Euphoria: 
            Theme of Love Yourself: Wonder," which featured the song "Euphoria" and embodied the "起" or "beginning" of the narrative sequence.</p>
          <p>In May 2018, BTS released their third Korean-language studio album, Love Yourself: Tear in conjunction with an appearance at the 25th Billboard Music Awards.
            At the show, BTS debuted as performers with the premiere of their lead single, "Fake Love"and won Top Social Artist, making them the only Korean artist to 
            win the award two years in a row. In the narrative sequence, the album coincided with the "轉" or "turn" of the series, touching on the tortuous 
            enlightenment of loving without being loved and encouragement to those without dreams.It received generally positive reviews from critics. Caitlin Kelley 
            from Billboard described the album as "one of their most thematically cohesive yet sonically varied albums, with maximalist production erupting against lyrics about emptiness,"
             while Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork wrote that the album "formula is a slick, loosely thematic album about love and loss, with a stronger focus on rapping than ever before" 
            and that it "aims for cohesion and produces fun, prismatic songs in the process."</p>

          <h5 class="mt-3">2019: Map of the Soul: Persona, stadium world tour and BTS World</h5>
          <p>In February 2019, BTS attended the 61st Grammy Awards as award presenters.It was their first time attending the event following an appearance 
            by the group at the LA Grammy Museum in 2018</p>
          <p>In April, BTS became the first Asian act to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify,and Time named them as one of Time 100's most influential people of 2019.
            Their sixth EP, Map of the Soul: Persona, was released on April 12 with the lead single "Boy with Luv" (Korean: 작은 것들을 위한 시; RR: Jageun geotdeureul wihan si), 
            featuring American singer Halsey.The EP's release was followed by a performance on Saturday Night Live, as the first Korean act to do so. The group's 
            appearance was anticipated as one of the biggest in the show's history. Commercially, BTS reached new career heights. Map of the Soul: Persona became 
            the first Korean-language album to reach the number one position in both the UK and Australia and the group's third consecutive album to top the Billboard 
            200 and the third within eleven months, joining the likes of the Beatles, who achieved the same in 1995–96. BTS are also the fastest group to get three number one 
            albums since The Monkees in 1967.The EP became the best selling physical album in the US for the year of 2019, with 312,000 physical sales. Map of the Soul: 
            Persona later became the best-selling album ever in South Korea, with more than 3.2 million sales in less than a month. Prior to BTS, the best-selling were dominated 
            by late 1990s albums, making BTS the only act formed after 2000 to be featured in the top 10 best-selling list.[214] "Boy with Luv" debuted at number 8 on the Billboard 
            Hot 100, the highest in history for a Korean group, and its music video became the most-viewed online video within the first 24 hours as of 2019, accumulating more 
            than 74.6 million views."Boy with Luv" was certified in multiple countries, including Australia where it was certified Gold for selling 35,000 units, and the US 
            where the RIAA certified it Platinum for selling over 1 million units. "Boy with Luv" was also certified Silver by the BPI, for selling over 200,000 units, making 
            it BTS' first single to attain this certification in the UK.
            Map of the Soul: Persona also attained Silver in the UK and Gold in France, selling over 60,000 units and 50,000 units respectively.</p>
          <h5 class="mt-3">2020: Map of the Soul: 7, "Dynamite", and Be</h5>
          <p>In January 2020, BTS released "Black Swan" along with a choreography art film performed by Slovenian-based MN Dance Company as the first single 
              from their fourth Korean-language studio album, Map of the Soul: 7. Album distributor Dreamus reported that stock pre-orders of the album

          <p>Map of the Soul: 7 was released on February 21 to universal acclaim. The album was supported by the lead single "On" and an alternative digital release 
              featuring Australian singer Sia. According to Gaon Chart, Map of the Soul: 7 sold over 4.1 million copies in just nine days after its release, 
              surpassing the record held by their previous album Map of the Soul: Persona to become the best-selling album in South Korean history and the 
              first album to be certified Quadruple Million.[281] The album debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 with a first-week tally of 422,000 album-equivalent units, 
              making BTS the fastest group to earn four number one albums since the Beatles in 1968.
               The album marked the biggest Billboard 200 debut in 2020[284] until The Weeknd's After Hours was released on March 20. The album debuted at number one in countries 
               such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S., making BTS the first Asian group to top the charts in the world's 
               five largest music markets. The lead single "On" debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 with 86,000 downloads, becoming BTS' first top five 
               and their biggest sales week for a song. It was the group's third top-ten and highest-charting single on the chart, giving them more top-ten 
               entries than any other Korean act on the Hot 100.In support of the Map of the Soul album series, BTS were set to embark on their fourth
                worldwide concert tour and second stadium tour, Map of the Soul Tour, beginning in April.

          <h5 class="mt-3">2021-present: BTS, the Best and "Butter"</h5>
          <p>On March 4, 2021, the IFPI named BTS its Global Recording Artist of the Year for 2020—they are the first non-English and Asian act to top the ranking. 
            BTS occupied three spots in the Global Album Sales Chart of 2020 with Map of the Soul: 7 coming at number one, Be (Deluxe Edition) at number two and 
            Map of the Soul: 7 – The Journey at number eight. In the newly launched Global Album All Format Chart, Map of the Soul: 7 claimed the first position while Be

             On March 14, BTS performed their song "Dynamite" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, becoming the first Korean nominee to have their own Grammy performance. 
             It was also their third appearance at the Grammys.The group's sixth compilation album, BTS, the Best is scheduled for release on June 16, 2021.On March 24, BTS

      <div id="tab3" class="pt-5">
        <h3 class="content_body">Artistry</h3>
        <h5 class="mt-3">Influences</h5>
        <p>BTS have cited Seo Taiji and Boys, Nas, Eminem, Kanye West, Drake, Post Malone, Charlie Puth and Danger as musical inspirations. 
          They have also cited Queen as an influence, with Suga saying he "grew up watching videos of Live Aid." During their concert at Wembley Stadium in London, 
          Jin paid tribute to Queen by leading the crowd in 
          a version of Freddie Mercury's "ay-oh" chant from the band's Live Aid concert.</p>
        <p>BTS are also influenced by many literary, psychological, artistic, and philosophical mediums. Their album Wings (2016) was inspired by Hermann 
          Hesse's coming of age novel, Demian.Their song "Blood Sweat and Tears" (2016) quotes Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 
          and its music video features visual references to Herbert James Draper's The Lament for Icarus, Pieter Bruegel's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, 
          and Pieter Bruegel's The Fall of the Rebel Angels. Their "Spring Day" (2017) music video contains lyrical and visual references to Ursula Le Guin's 
          short story The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas. The Love Yourself series was primarily influenced by Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving, while their song 
          "Magic Shop" from Love Yourself: Tear (2018) was inspired by James R. Doty's memoir Into the Magic Shop.
           Their 2019 album, Map of the Soul: Persona gained its name from Murray Stein's Jung's Map of the Soul: An Introduction.</p>
        <h5 class="mt-3">Musical style</h5>
        <p>BTS co-write and produce much of their own output. Since their inception, BTS have developed and maintained a style of "fusion music"
           with an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers and their main producer Pdogg.
            Rather than adhering to a specific genre, BTS have introduced new elements into their sound and musical repertoire with each successive release.
             Beginning with old-school hip hop on 2 Cool 4 Skool and O!RUL8,2? in 2013, BTS first experimented with R&B and rock on Skool Luv Affair and Dark and 
             Wild in 2014;orchestral strings and EDM in their The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series (2015–16); moombahton, neo soul, 
             and gospel on Wings (2016) and You Never Walk Alone (2017); future bass, Latin pop, and jazz hip hop in their Love Yourself album series (2017–18);
           and emo rap, rap rock, Afro pop, nu-disco, funk, trap, pop rock and pop rap in their Map of the Soul album series (2019–20)</p>
        <h5 class="mt-3">Lyrical themes</h5>
        <p>BTS' albums contain recurring themes that fall under the overarching theme of "reflection of youth." Their "school trilogy" explored "the troubles and anxieties 
          of school-age youth." Their "youth series" "tackled a subject that the vast majority of youth experience, but few pop musicians articulate well: mental 
          health and the desire to belong in society."[381] Wings (2016) focused on temptation and sin. The "Love Yourself" series utilized a narrative form to 
          illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love. Their lyrics, which often include social commentary and criticisms of
           South Korean society, clearly reflect these. Songs such as "No More Dream" and "N.O" from their school trilogy were motivated by their experiences with South Korea's 
           emphasis on education and called for change to the education system and societal expectations. Their experiences with youth culture in South Korea inspired the songs 
           "Dope" and "Silver Spoon" (Korean: 뱁새; RR: Baepsae) from their youth series, referencing generational disparity and millennials giving up of romantic relationships, 
           marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older 
           generations. "Am I Wrong" from Wings (2016) questioned societal apathy towards the state of current events—the lyric "We're all dogs and pigs / we become dogs 
           because we're angry" referenced the South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook, who was a proponent of the caste system and described the average person 
           as "dogs and pigs", and BTS performed the song on television during the 2016 South Korean political scandal that led to the impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye.
            RM and Suga's personal struggles with mental health inspired songs like "Tomorrow", "Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life", "So Far Away", "The Last", and "Forever Rain."
            "Not Today" from You Never Walk Alone (2017) is an anti-establishment anthem,
           with messages advocating for minority groups, while "Spring Day" honored the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy.</p>

        <h3 class="content_body">Cultural impact and commerical performance</h3>
        <h5 class="mt-3">Cultural impact</h5>
        <p>BTS have been described as "easily the biggest and most successful name in K-pop in the world" that can "do things no other name in their genre can",
           with Time giving them the nickname "Princes of Pop". Billboard's Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS are comparable to and as 
           influential as the Beatles and The Monkees. Nielsen Music Vice President Helena Kosinski said that "although BTS weren't the first to open the
            doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic.
            " As the first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were 
            the second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming second only to Drake. In 2019, BTS were 
            again named as one of the top 10 Global Recording Artists of the Year by IFPI, for a second time, ranking #7. In 2020, BTS became the first
             non-English artist to be named IFPI's #1 Global Recording Artist of the Year. They currently remain as the only non-English speaking act to enter that list.
              In the United States, BTS accounted for 72.7 percent of the album consumption units generated by K-pop acts in 2018 out of a total of 17 acts.
              In South Korea, BTS accounted for 41.9 percent of album sales in the first half of 2019, up from their market share of 25.3 percent the previous year.
               In November 2019, Billboard ranked BTS at #4 on their Top Social Artist of the 2010s list, making them the highest group on the list. 
               BTS was also ranked #45 on Billboard's Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list. 
          They are the highest-ranked Asian act on the list as well as the only non-English speaking act</p>
        <h5 class="mt-3">Commercial performance</h5>
        <p>BTS have measurably revitalized the Korean economy and the global music industry. Credited for the 
          surge in popularity of online purchases of K-pop items and the growth of the Korean Wave between 2016 and 2018 by the Korea 
          Customs Service and Korea Foundation, BTS were cited as one of the main driving forces for the recovery of South Korea's music-related 
          sector to levels seen before China's 2016 ban on domestic cultural contents over soured diplomatic relations. Yung Duk Kim, vice president 
          and chief operating officer of the Korea Creative Content Agency, stated K-pop has “skyrocketed” since BTS' popularity surged, creating jobs not only for 
          BTS and theirteam but other K-pop idols as well. Various news outlets coined the term the "BTS effect" to refer to the commercial effects of 
          BTS' influence, such as when KB Kookmin Bank savings accounts increased six-fold compared to the prior year following BTS' endorsement and when 
          stock prices of entertainment companies in South Korea shot up for five days after BTS topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The effect was also observed when 
          companies tied to BTS, such as Netmarble, NetMark, Soribada, Key Shares, GMP, Diffie, and Mattel had their stocks rise. In October 2019, Mattel's international 
          gross sales rose 10% to $721.7 million, lifted by sales of dolls based on BTS. Data firm SM2 Networks estimated Hyundai Motor received KR₩600 billion 
          ($502 million) in promotional results after commissioning BTS as their promotional models in 2018 The Bank of Korea Economic Statistics System stated 
          that South Korea's BOP for music and entertainment reached $114.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, attributing this to an improved relationship 
          between China and South Korea, 
          and the breakout global success of BTS, particularly in North America</p>

        <p>The BTS Universe, also known as the Bangtan Universe or BU, is an alternate universe created by Big Hit Entertainment that winds through the group's output. 
          The webtoon Save Me closely follows the story line, along with their book HYYH: The Notes 1. The chronology of the universe began with 
          the song "I Need U" and spans to the present time. It tells the story of the seven members in an alternate reality and 
          depicts their anxieties and uncertainties as they confront their futures. In a corporate briefing held on February 4, 2020, 
          Big Hit also announced the upcoming release of its sequel HYYH: The Notes 2, the recreation of five BTS songs into five 
          picture books, and the upcoming drama Youth to be produced in collaboration with Chorokbaem Media and renowned screenwriter Kim Soo-jin.
           Speaking to Billboard, Michelle Cho, an assistant professor of East Asian Popular Cultures at the University of Toronto, said "As an audio-visual 
           experience, "I Need U" inaugurated the Bangtan Universe—the coming-of-age storyline that brilliantly integrates the Most Beautiful Moment in Life 
           [album] trilogy and continues in music videos, "concept videos" (mini-films), 
          and the multiform, open-ended narrative that's been serialized in album liner notes and Twitter and Instagram posts."</p>
