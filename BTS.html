                <p class="mt-3"> <span><strong>BTS</strong></span>  (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, 
                    is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
                    The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. 
                    Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused 
                    on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming-of-age, loss, 
                    the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts 
                    and includes an alternative universe storyline. 
                    The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After debuting in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language
                     studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea.
                      By 2017, BTS crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records. 
                      They became the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", 
                      as well as the first Korean act to top the US Billboard 200 chart with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). BTS also became the fastest group 
                      since the Beatles to earn four US number-one albums, doing so in less than two years. Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified 
                      platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100 with 
                      their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite" and remix of "Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)" and, with the release of "Life Goes On", 
                    became the first group to have two number one debuts on the Hot 100.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Having sold over 20 million albums on the Gaon Music Chart, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds 
                  the best-selling album in South Korea with Map of the Soul: 7. They are the first and only Asian and non-English speaking act 
                  to be named the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year (2020) and to chart on Billboard's Top Touring Artists of the 2010s 
                  (placing at number 45). During their Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline 
                  and sell out Wembley Stadium and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history. Featured on Time's 
                  international cover as "Next Generation Leaders", BTS has also appeared in the magazine's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) 
                  and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019), where they were dubbed "Princes of Pop". Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of 
                  Korea in 2018 and 2020, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. As of 2019, BTS is purportedly 
                  worth more than US$4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP.[6] They attract one in every 13 foreign tourists who visited South Korea 
                  and were cited as one of the key acts in boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout their career, BTS received numerous accolades for their work, including 6 American Music Awards, 
                  9 Billboard Music Awards and 24 Golden Disk Awards, and nominations for a Grammy Award and a Brit Award.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the establishment of their Love Myself anti-violence campaign in partnership with UNICEF, BTS addressed the United Nations 73rd and 75th General 
                  Assemblies and became the youngest ever recipients of the 
                  Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.

        <h3 class="content_body">Name</h3>
        <p>The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團), literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". 
          According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents 
          like bullets".In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団), which translates similarly. In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity.[11] This extended their name to mean 
          "growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward."</p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">2010–2014: Formation and early years</h5>
        <p>BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.BTS was originally 
          supposed to be a hip-hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM, but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided that the 
          contemporary youth needed instead "a hero who can lend them a shoulder to lean on, even without speaking a single word".The group was meant to debut in 
          2011 and featured on several tracks by artists such as 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before their debut was postponed and the group was reorganized into a more 
          traditional idol group.The lineup was then finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in 2012. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain 
          attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.</p>
        <p>On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, the first installment in their "school trilogy" 
          series, simultaneously with its lead single "No More Dream", which peaked at number 124 in Korea before quickly falling off the charts.
           While the album peaked at number five in South Korea and eventually sold over 145,000 copies,it was not a major hit, selling only 24,000 copies in 2013.
           Their subsequent single “We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2” failed to chart. In 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound with scratches from the 1980s–90s 
           and excessively fierce visuals.BTS have stated that from their inception, they were convinced that telling their story was the only way for the younger generation 
           to relate to their music.The lyrics of the album primarily reflected on the misunderstanding and prejudice towards them, criticism of the society that diminishes 
           their dreams, and their anxiety and determination towards their future.During the production of the album, Suga and RM rewrote the lyrics of “No More Dream” more 
           than 20 times.The single album's release was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows.Despite being unpolished, critics say these early live 
           performances demonstrated BTS' potential with their intense and charismatic stage presence.[26] Expanding their endeavors to Japan, 
          "No More Dream" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014</p>
        <p>In September 2013, BTS released the second part to their "school trilogy,” the extended play O!RUL8,2?, along with its single "N.O,” which peaked at number 92 in Korea.
          The EP peaked at number four in Korea and has sold over 160,000 copies to date, including 34,000 copies in its release year.Musically, BTS did not fundamentally 
          change their sound as compared with 2 Cool 4 Skool, utilizing fiery rapping along with trap beats, brass, and soulful melodies. Lyrically, the EP expanded on the t
          heme of dreams and happiness, revealing their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and their determination to confront the struggle of proving themselves.
           Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts.That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV's Rookie 
           King Channel Bangtan, based on a fake broadcast station, "Channel Bangtan", through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea.
           At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, 
          including the 5th Melon Music Awards, 28th Golden Disc Awards and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards</p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">2014–2015: Moderate success and first concert tour</h5>
        <p>The last act of their "school trilogy", the EP Skool Luv Affair, was released in January 2014 and topped the Gaon Album Chart, selling 100,000 copies in 2014 
          and over 250,000 copies overall.It also marked BTS' first appearance on Billboard's World Albums Chart, peaking at number three.The album was supported by the 
          singles "Boy in Luv" (Korean: 상남자; RR: Sang-namja) and "Just One Day" (Korean: 하루만; RR: Haruman), which peaked at number 45 and number 149 in Korea, respectively.
          While Skool Luv Affair musically retained much of their hip-hop influences with the incorporation of R&B and hard rock, the album coincided with a thematic shift 
          from dreams and happiness to love, focusing on school-age and youthful love.Following Skool Luv Affair's release, BTS made several appearances on Korean music 
          shows and held their first fan meeting that March with an audience of 3,000 fans in Seoul.That July, BTS held their first concert in the 
          United States in West Hollywood for free to an audience of 200 fans.In August, the group also made their first appearance at KCON in Los Angeles</p>
        <p>In August 2014, BTS released their first Korean studio album, Dark & Wild, which peaked at number two in Korea and sold over 200,000 copies total.
          It was supported by two singles: "Danger" and "War of Hormone" (Korean: 호르몬 전쟁; RR: Horeumon Jeonjaeng), which peaked at number 58 and number 173 in Korea, respectively.
           The album served as a narrative extension of the “school trilogy” and a transition into their next series. Musically, the album fused the grungy electric guitar sounds 
           of rock within the framework of hip-hop and continued to expand their sound towards R&B. The central theme of the album's lyrics focused on expressing the sentiments of
            maturing, youthful desires, and impatience for romance.During production of the album, BTS recorded their single "Danger" in a makeshift studio in a garage in Los
             Angeles.Following several appearances on Korean music shows, BTS embarked on their first concert tour, 2014 BTS 
          Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, from October to December, held in various halls and theaters in six cities: Seoul, Kobe, Tokyo, Manila, Singapore, and Bangkok</p>
        <p>Their first Japanese studio album, Wake Up (2014), released that December, peaked at number three on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart and sold 28,000 copies.
          Along with re-recorded Japanese versions of older songs, it also contained the original tracks "Wake Up" and "The Stars." In support of the album, BTS held 
          their 1st Japan Tour 2015 Wake Up: Open Your Eyes in February 2015 to an audience of 25,000 fans in four cities.
          After ending their Japan tour, BTS held their second solo concert in Korea, BTS Live Trilogy Episode I: BTS Begins, in March to a crowd of 6,500 fans</p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-3">2015–2016: Mainstream breakthrough and commercial success</h5>
        <p>Shifting their sound and image from solely aggressive, masculine hip hop to more diverse styles,BTS wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of "youth"
           and settled on the title of "花樣年華" (Korean: 화양연화; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa), loosely interpreted to define "youth" as "the most beautiful moment in life."
           Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (March 2015), explored the growth and emotional agony of youth as well as its playful and uplifting sides.
            Fuse included it as the only Korean album on their list of the "27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far."[55] The EP has sold over 415,000 copies to date.
            Its lead single "I Need U" was BTS' first top five hit in Korea and garnered BTS first ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show.[58] While its second single,
             "Dope (Korean: 쩔어; RR: Jjeoreo)", only peaked at number 44 in Korea,it peaked at number three on Billboard's World Digital Songs Chart and became their
              first music video to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube in October. The group began the world tour extension of their Red Bullet Tour in June, titled 
              2015 Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and Latin America.Their fourth Japanese single, "For You", 
              was released on June 17 to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese debut and topped Oricon's daily chart, selling over 42,000 copies within its first day.
          BTS later performed at Japan's Summer Sonic Festival on August 15 and 16.</p>

          <p>In the lead up to their next album, BTS released an original eight-episode documentary series exclusively on YouTube Premium entitled Burn the Stage 
            that ran from March until May 2018, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the group's 2017 Wings Tour. In April, the group also released their 
            third Japanese studio album, Face Yourself, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200 as the third-highest-charting Japanese album in the history 
            of the chart. In conjunction with the release of Face Yourself, the group released a nine-minute short film titled "Euphoria: 
            Theme of Love Yourself: Wonder," which featured the song "Euphoria" and embodied the "起" or "beginning" of the narrative sequence.</p>
          <p>In May 2018, BTS released their third Korean-language studio album, Love Yourself: Tear in conjunction with an appearance at the 25th Billboard Music Awards.
            At the show, BTS debuted as performers with the premiere of their lead single, "Fake Love"and won Top Social Artist, making them the only Korean artist to 
            win the award two years in a row. In the narrative sequence, the album coincided with the "轉" or "turn" of the series, touching on the tortuous 
            enlightenment of loving without being loved and encouragement to those without dreams.It received generally positive reviews from critics. Caitlin Kelley 
            from Billboard described the album as "one of their most thematically cohesive yet sonically varied albums, with maximalist production erupting against lyrics about emptiness,"
             while Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork wrote that the album "formula is a slick, loosely thematic album about love and loss, with a stronger focus on rapping than ever before" 
            and that it "aims for cohesion and produces fun, prismatic songs in the process."</p>
